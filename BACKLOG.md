# Backlog

What is known to be left to do, kept here so it does not live only on one
machine. The user-facing summary is under "For later" in the
[README](README.md#for-later); detailed plans are in [docs/plans/](docs/plans/)
(in Portuguese).

## Security

Leftovers of the security pass that came from an external audit
([docs/plans/security.md](docs/plans/security.md); PRs #37 to #40 did the
rest).

1. **Entering a compressed TAR still freezes the screen.** Listing a
   `.tar.gz`/`.xz`/`.bz2`/`.zst` decompresses all of it, synchronously, in
   `pane.rs` (`Reader::list`); a decompression bomb freezes Xylem there.
   Copying out of it lists it again (`Operation::reading_archive`), a
   second full pass. Medium: list once, in the background and cancellable
   (like `archive::Extractor`), and reuse the list for the copy.
2. **eXecute (`%f`, `%t`) on Windows.** `cmd` expands `%VAR%` even inside
   quotes, so a name with `%PATH%` in it changes. E and O already avoid it
   by passing the file in `XY_FILE`; commands typed with X still put the
   names in the line. Could pass each file in a variable of its own.
3. **ssh password through a file on Windows.** On Unix the askpass answer
   goes through a named pipe (mode 0600); on Windows it is written to a file
   under `%LOCALAPPDATA%` (private to the user) for a moment. A Windows
   named pipe would avoid the disk. Low priority; needs testing on Windows.
4. **Searching inside an archive reads each entry in one step.** Memory is
   bounded now (streamed), but a huge entry holds the screen up while it is
   searched, as a huge file on disk does. The search could keep the open
   reader between steps.

5. **What the table readers still cannot limit.** The time limit stops them
   between records, and SQLite midway, but a spreadsheet's reader loads the whole
   sheet first: its size is checked before that, by what the ZIP declares, so a
   ZIP that lies about its sizes gets through. A Parquet page is decompressed
   whole too. Esc cannot interrupt a table being read, only the time limit can.
6. **SQLite and Parquet's zstd are C libraries: replace them with Rust as soon
   as a usable option appears.** The author's decision. They run only with V,
   never in Autoview, and that is meant to be temporary. What to watch:
   - zstd: a way for the `parquet` crate to decode through a Rust codec; Xylem
     already has `ruzstd` for `.zst` files.
   - SQLite: a Rust implementation that reads real SQLite files reliably and is
     mature enough for hostile ones. Limbo is now Turso Database (crate `turso`).
     Checked on 2026-10-30, at 0.9.0-pre: not yet. Replace it when it has reached
     1.0, builds with no C (`default-features = false`, `pure-rust-crypto`, no
     `mimalloc`), and a fuzz of corrupt files no longer makes it panic or hang.
   Once one is replaced, its format can go back to Autoview. Until then, running
   them in a separate, isolated process would contain a bug in them. Also recheck
   the C dependencies whenever these crates are updated: `cargo tree | grep -- -sys`.

Decided against: wiping the password from memory (`zeroize`: ssh and the
pipe hold it too), and checking where remote symlinks point (copying a link
as a link is what `cp -a` and `rsync -l` do).

## Features

- **Remote machines, phases 3 and 4** (phases 1 and 2 are in 0.4.0):
  3. writing on the remote machine: upload, move, delete, rename, mkdir,
     chmod, dates; needs a filesystem layer under `ops` and the tree scan;
  4. finishing: Edit and Open via temporary download and upload, eXecute
     over ssh, Git over ssh, periodic refresh instead of inotify.
- **Disk usage, phases 3 and 4** ([docs/plans/usage.md](docs/plans/usage.md);
  phases 1 and 2 are in 0.4.0): actions inside the Usage view (tag, delete,
  prune, viewer); optional treemap, grouping by type, export.
- **Duplicate files** ([docs/plans/usage.md](docs/plans/usage.md), "Duplicados";
  [the manual](docs/manual/duplicates.md)): done on local folders, whole folders
  included, and through rclone by the service's hashes. Still open: over SSH
  (needs writing on the remote machine, phase 3 above, to be of use); whole
  folders in the cloud.
- **Cloud mounts:** `*` asks rclone for the whole branch at once
  ([the manual](docs/manual/cloud.md)). Still open: opening the root of a large
  Drive reads every folder in it before the first draw (over 29 s on a blank
  screen, with a cold cache); Branch, Usage and Compare still read folder by
  folder, and a single slow read holds the screen up.
- **Xylem in its own window**, further ahead: see "For later" in the README.
- Postponed by choice: macros, chown, Graft, macOS.
- **New file viewers** ([docs/plans/viewers.md](docs/plans/viewers.md)):
  six subprojects, security first. Done: subproject 1 (encodings, compressed
  files, the size limit; PRs #44 to #49), and the table mode with SQLite and the
  SQL filter (subprojects 2 and 5; PR #63), documented in
  [the manual](docs/manual/viewer.md). Still to do: SDF in the table mode, as an
  extra; the windowed viewer (3); logs (4); external converters (6).
- **Rendered Markdown in the viewer**
  ([docs/plans/markdown.md](docs/plans/markdown.md)): done, on `.md` and
  `.markdown`. Still open: the help's small parser could move to the same
  parser one day (it also feeds the man page); icons with Nerd Fonts were left
  out on purpose, because they add nothing to the rendering itself.
- **Batch over files and records** ([docs/plans/batch.md](docs/plans/batch.md)):
  complete. Left for when they are missed: Parquet and XLSX as outputs. Records into
  `.bat`/`.cmd` wait for item 2 of Security.
- **HTML rendered in the viewer**, after the Markdown mode: study a way to show
  `.html` acceptably, not perfectly: whoever wants a faithful page opens it in the
  browser. `pulldown-cmark` does not read HTML. First candidates: `html2text`, or
  `html5ever` directly to share the Markdown mode's drawing. Nothing runs or is
  downloaded (no JavaScript, CSS or images), links show their real address, and H
  still reaches the source: without CSS, text a page hides does appear.

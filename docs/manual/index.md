# Xylem manual

Xylem is a text-mode file manager inspired by XTree and ZTreeWin: a directory
tree on top, the files of the current directory below, and statistics on the
right. It logs (reads) directories into memory, so you can tag files across a
whole branch and copy, move, delete, compare or rename them in one go.

Xylem treats untrusted files as hostile: it should never crash, hang, run
code, write outside the destination or exhaust memory because of what a file
contains or how it is named. Nevertheless, bugs happen. See the security
statement in the README for the full list of safeguards and recommendations.

**F1** (or **Alt+H**, for terminals that keep F1 for themselves) opens help
about what you are doing: inside a prompt, the help for that prompt; in the
tree or the file window, the help for that window. In the help, **Tab** and
**Shift+Tab** pick a link, **Enter** follows it, **Backspace** goes back,
**I** shows this index, **K** the keys in effect, **L** switches the language
and **Esc** closes.

**Help with the translations:** the versions of this manual in Spanish,
French, German and Chinese have not been reviewed by native speakers.
If you read one of these languages and find an error or something that sounds
odd, please suggest an improvement: `https://github.com/andrelnfernandes/xylem/issues`.
